 Work/Project examples
1. https://vikramjeetlubana.com/ and https://vikramjeetlubana.netlify.app/  - These are two links to my portfolio. Sometimes I use one of the domains for practicing purposes.
2. https://healingtouchwc.com/testweb/ - Made webpage along with another person for a client.
3. https://movieratingvsl.netlify.app/ - The unattractive movie review sites forced me to experiment something of my own.

 Inspiration
 https://movieratingvsl.netlify.app/ , https://musicpreview.netlify.app/ , https://wgif.netlify.app/ are some of the web apps which I tried to implement my skills on. Other than that I also tried some new frameworks so that I could make it more interactive and learn new tools. 
 
 Focus
My focus would be to learn new web technology tools and frameworks for backend. Another field which I would love is Graphic designing tools for creating more user friendly applications.

 Code challenge
These are the steps which I took to create the web page for an Italian restaurant that was given as a coding challenge.
1. I used Jquery And Bootstrap by using CDN which is used for grid layuout for responsive web page. It becomes easier with Jquery to manipulate DOM tags with JQuery rather than using vanilla javascript.
2. I used filer and sort method on array of objects to divide and display menu items for various categories.
3. AOS (Animation On Scroll), a javascript library used for animation is also used in this page so that the page could look interactive.
4. Jquery is used to append the tags in DOM.
5. Google Fonts such as Roboto and Pangolin.
6. I added another property in each object item called image with string url to it image.
7. Checkbox for sorting non spicy food vs all food items has been implemented by using input tag.
