 Work/Project examples
1. https://vikramjeetlubana.com/ and https://vikramjeetlubana.netlify.app/  - These are two links to my portfolio. Sometimes I use one of the domains for practicing purposes.
2. https://healingtouchwc.com/testweb/ - Made webpage along with another person for a client.
3. https://movieratingvsl.netlify.app/ - The unattractive movie review sites forced me to experiment something of my own.

 Inspiration
https://movieratingvsl.netlify.app/ , https://musicpreview.netlify.app/ , https://wgif.netlify.app/ are some of the web apps which I tried to implement my skills on. Other than that I also tried some new frameworks so that I could make it more interactive and learn new tools. 
 
 Focus
My focus would be to learn new web technology tools and frameworks for backend. Another field which I would love is Graphic designing tools for creating more user friendly applications.
